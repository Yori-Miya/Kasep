## 💡 HOW CI/CD WORKS NOW

### Every time you push to GitHub:
```
git push origin main
    ↓
GitHub Actions detects change
    ↓
Automatically runs workflow:
  1. Build your code
  2. Run tests/lint
  3. Deploy to Firebase
    ↓
App goes LIVE (2-3 min later)
```

### You just need to:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "your message"
git push origin main
# Done! Rest is automatic
```

---

## 🔐 SECURITY NOTES

- ✅ SSH key stored locally (won't be shared)
- ✅ Firebase secret only in GitHub vault
- ✅ Secret not exposed in logs
- ✅ Deployment fully automated & secure
